# Build the Quarlcoin Windows installer (msys2/mingw64).
#
#   1. Stages a self-contained runtime bundle:
#        - the 5 binaries (quarl-qt, quarld, quarl-cli, quarl-tx,
#          quarl-wallet)
#        - the Qt6 runtime + plugins via windeployqt6
#        - the full mingw/3rd-party DLL closure (sqlite/zmq/icu/freetype/... and
#          the libgcc/libstdc++/libwinpthread runtime), gathered from `ldd`
#   2. Runs makensis on share/setup.nsi to produce
#        dist/quarlcoin-<version>-win64-setup.exe
#
# Everything is staged into an ASCII WORKDIR first: makensis (like moc/lupdate)
# cannot handle non-ASCII characters in the source path, so the inputs are
# copied to a plain-ASCII working directory and the finished installer is
# copied back to dist/.
#
# The build dir must already be built (cmake --build <BUILDDIR> -DENABLE_GUI=ON).
# Env overrides: BUILDDIR, MINGW_BIN, MAKENSIS, WORKDIR.
