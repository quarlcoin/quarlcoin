# Generates the NSIS installer script from share/setup.nsi.in, filling in the
# Quarlcoin name/version/paths, mirroring Bitcoin Core's
# cmake/module/GenerateSetupNsi.cmake. The version flows from project(), so it
# is no longer hand-maintained in the .nsi. @ONLY substitution touches only
# @VAR@ tokens, leaving NSIS's own ${...} / $(...) syntax untouched.
#
# The makensis run itself is driven by tools/build-installer.sh (it stages the
# generated script + the windeployqt runtime bundle into a plain-ASCII workdir,
# since makensis can't read through the Cyrillic-path junction).
